Sure! Let's go through your diagrams and explanations, and make the necessary corrections to the Mermaid syntax and overall flow.

### Input and Output:

These two diagrams are already correct. They show the input and output arrays clearly.

### Input:
```mermaid
graph LR
A1[1] --> A2[1] --> A3[1] --> A4[2] --> A5[2] --> A6[3]
```

### Output (for `k = 2`):
```mermaid
graph LR
B1[1] --> B2[2]
```

### Step-by-Step Algorithm Explanation:

#### First Step: Fill the Frequency Map

This diagram is mostly correct, but we will adjust the layout to ensure clarity and alignment of the steps.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Step_1[Fill the map with number and its frequency]
        A1[Number 1] --> A2[Count: 3]
        B1[Number 2] --> B2[Count: 2]
        C1[Number 3] --> C2[Count: 1]
    end
```

#### Second Step: Group Numbers by Frequency

This step visually groups the numbers by their frequency.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Step_2[Group numbers by frequency]
        F1[Frequency 1] --> N3[Number 3]
        F2[Frequency 2] --> N2[Number 2]
        F3[Frequency 3] --> N1[Number 1]
    end
```

### Third Step: Extract Top `k` Frequent Numbers

This diagram explains how the algorithm iterates in reverse order and collects the top `k` frequent numbers. Letâ€™s make the flow more readable.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Step_3[Extract top k frequent numbers]
        V3[Frequency: 3] --> N1[Number: 1]
        V2[Frequency: 2] --> N2[Number: 2]
        V1[Frequency: 1] --> N3[Number: 3]

        N1 --> R1[Add 1 to result]
        N2 --> R2[Add 2 to result]
        
        R1 --> Final_Result[Result = [1, 2]]
    end
```

### Full Process Flow:

Here is the full corrected flow, combining all the steps:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Input[Step 1: Original Array]
        A1[1] --> A2[1] --> A3[1] --> A4[2] --> A5[2] --> A6[3]
    end

    Input --> Map[Step 2: Fill frequency map]
    
    subgraph Map[Frequency Map]
        B1[1 -> Count: 3]
        B2[2 -> Count: 2]
        B3[3 -> Count: 1]
    end
    
    Map --> Group[Step 3: Group numbers by frequency]
    
    subgraph Group[Group by Frequency]
        G1[Frequency 1] --> Num3[Number 3]
        G2[Frequency 2] --> Num2[Number 2]
        G3[Frequency 3] --> Num1[Number 1]
    end
    
    Group --> Extract[Step 4: Extract top k frequent numbers]

    subgraph Extract[Extract Top k]
        Res1[res.push_back(1)] --> Res2[res.push_back(2)]
        Res2 --> FinalResult[res = [1, 2]]
    end
```

### Final Corrections:

- We ensured all steps flow logically, connecting the **input** to the process of building the frequency map, grouping by frequency, and finally extracting the top `k` elements.
- Each Mermaid diagram now clearly represents the algorithm's steps, making the overall explanation and visuals cohesive.

Does this work for you, or would you like any further adjustments?
